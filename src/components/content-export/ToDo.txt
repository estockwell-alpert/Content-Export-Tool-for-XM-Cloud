IMPORT TEMPLATES:
https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/getting-started/examples/import

Export data to XLSX

Add Browse Fields for Auth endpoint (can use same logic as the schema export!) ✔

Auth export defaults to export in all languages. Fix it to default to the main site language

Standard Fields (Created, Updated etc) - add to Edge??

Add browse content/templates tree like in old tool?



JEFF:

Update IMPORT for new export format (Section on its own line)

Additional formatting would be a nice-to-have but would probably take some time to figure out how to programmatically do that in Excel.
    Create groups for each template
    Add colors and borders to highlight where templates start/end


SORTING - make Rendering params come second ✔
Import - SOURCE ✔
Import - Required
Import - base templates ✔
Export - base templates ✔
Order of fields - obey Sortorder if present, automatically set Sortorder on import based on field index * 100 ✔
Set Display Name as well as Title 
Move Required to after Field Type ✔
